KATANAFxFloorBoard version 20110317: 17 March 2011
*****************************************************
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DONATE, YOU MAY FREELY USE THIS SOFTWARE, 
 JUST KEEP IN MIND THE 7000 HOURS SPENT OVER 5 YEARS GETTING IT HERE,
  I WOULD LOVE A BEER!!!. :-)
but then patches created by you for sharing with all would be nice too.
you can email patches and custom system settings saved files to the above address.
***********************************************************************************
 ********* LATEST FEATURES ADDED****************************************************
 *Added more Text Summary Dialog features. 
 *Separate Assign edit-pages for Bulk Patch editing of individual Assigns. 
 *Bulk Patch Editing - One effect change can be applied to a series of patches in one operation. 
 *Whats This Help dialog added, with the press of the [F1] button. 
 *Auditioning of Patches within Bulk Files, high-lighted file is sent to the KATANA for instant auditioning before loading. 
 *Temp Clipboard copied events are saved to file and are re-loaded on FxFloorbOard startup. 
 *Text Dialog for Printing or Saving to File complete patch settings list.
 *New Framework with better Windows 7 and Mac Snow Leopard support, auto temp buffer request on connect. 
 *Multi Language support for French, German, and Chinese. 
 *Bulk File save/restore in 3 formats *.gcl, *.mid & *.syx so your Boss Librarian can use the Bulk files 
        and the FxFloorBoard can load in Bulk backups of patches, system and Global data. 
 *The editor now supports using Boss Librarian *.gcl files.
 *ClipBoard buttons have been added to the main page selectin bar (below) and can copy up to
        5 opened patches for quick comparison. 
 *The editpages have 5 patch pertial paste buttons added, where the single effect part only part is copyed from
        the associated clipBoard and replaces the current settings for that one effect only.

********* FIRST USE CONNECTION HINTS ************** 
 
a.) Connect the KATANA via a USB cable, 
ensure the Boss usb driver software is installed and the SYSTEM>USB>Driver setting on the GT100 is set to 'advanced'.

b.) In most cases the program should select GT 10 device and connect automaticaly, if not, then follow the next two steps.
Start the FxFloorBoard program, for the Menu select Preferences/Midi and select the GT100 midi device for midi input and output.

c.) Select the editor program "Connect" button, it should stay "on" if all connections are correct.

d.) Open the Patch-Tree side panel by clicking your mouse pointer on the 'yellow arrow', 
the Patch-Tree has items which will expand when you click on the [+] symbols.
 When the tree items expand, you will see the patch names appear as the editor requests this information from the GT100.

e.) A single mouse pointer click on the Patch-Tree name will change the GT100 to that selected patch only 
- sound played through the GT100 will have the sound of that patch.
 
f.) A double click on the patch name will load the patch information from the GT100 into the editor, 
all the patch settings will update the editor GUI.

g.) Any knob turning will change the sound of the effect being adjusted, 
when the desired sound is achieved, you can either save the patch to the GT100 or save the patch to file on disk.

h.) To save the patch to the GT100, select a location with a 'single-click' on the Patch-Tree,
then press the "write/sync" button. 

****************** If there is a problem 'connecting' ensure the KATANA UNIT ID is set to "1" (factory default) 
* and the midi channel is set to "1".*************************************************************************

GT100-FxFloorBoard: 
NOTE: THIS IS AN UNPAID PROJECT, SO FAR INVESTING OVER 7000 HOURS OF MY TIME OVER 5 YEARS, 
also I WILL NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS, even though TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY. 

files can be saved/loaded as syx or mid (SMF) or gcl (Librarian) formats.
the KATANAFxFloorBoard will also open GT100B *.gxb & *.mid files, and translate GT-8 patch files (*.syx single patch type).

layout increased, which may be a problem for low screen resolutions. (i use 1280 X 800 minimum)

This project is a continuing session of evolution.........

patch tree to the left side should give patch change on single click and (when 'connected' button active),
 double click should request patch transfer.
opening each bank node should request patch names (while 'connected').

patch rename by doubleclicking name display panel.
