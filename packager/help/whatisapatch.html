<body><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="help.html">Index</a><h2 style="font-family: Arial;">What is a Patch?</h2><span style="font-family: Arial;">A
&#8220;patch&#8221; is a unit of sound on the KATANA. In addition to settings
determining the type of sound, a patch also contains effect settings.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">You
can modify (edit) the settings of a patch, and save it as a &#8220;user
patch.&#8221; (The factory supplied patches already built into the KATANA are called &#8220;preset
patches.&#8221;)</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each
patch contains all of the settings for the PCM 1 and 2 synthesizers,
for the COSM Modeling instruments, for the Normal Pickup settings, and
for all of the effects for that memory location in the KATANA.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>The KATANA stores hundreds of such patches, where you can assign each a number and a name, like <span style="font-weight: bold;">USER : 20-2 : RnB Section</span>. The following illustration from the owner's manual shows what kind of information is stored in each patch.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;"><a style="font-family: Arial;" href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/KATANAFloorBoard/KATANA-Help-HTML/images/patch.jpg"><img src="images/patch.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 809px; height: 491px;" alt="A KATANA patch contains four main components: the synthesizer sound with PCM1 and/or PCM2 synths and multi-effects, the modeling sound with amp and guitar effects, the normal pickup sound, and the effects shared by all of the sounds." title="KATANA patch structure"></a><br style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
following screenshot from the KATANA FloorBoard Editor shows the patch
structure similarly in the blue area, with modules for the sound sources and the
effects. The modules use lighted buttons to indicate ON/OFF,
potentiometer-like knobs, and pull-down menu fields for selecting sound
sources and setting effects module
parameters. <br><br>In
the Patch Tree, the black area at the left in the screenshot below, you
can see a list of the patches from my KATANA, sorted by bank numbers and
then patches within the banks, corresponding to the Bank and Patch
numbers in my KATANA. The KATANA FloorBoard Editor provides several tools
to help you view your patches is several useful ways. Look at the menu
bar item <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools &gt; </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="patch_text_summary.html">Patch Text Summary</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="system_global_text_summary.html" target="_blank">System Global Text Summary</a>, and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" href="patch_list_summary.html">KATANA Patch&nbsp;List Summary</a>
to explore these tools. One of the nice features of the KATANA
FloorBoard Editor is that you can click on any patch in the Patch Tree
panel to instantly audition it in the KATANA. <br><br>There are four sound sources available in the KATANA which
can be used individually or in any combination. The sound sources are listed below
and shown on the left side in the above and following images and are referred to&nbsp;in the Owner's Manual as 'tones':</span><br style="font-family: Arial;"><div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial;"><ul><li>PCM SYNTH 1</li><li>PCM SYNTH 2</li><li>COSM MODELING</li><li>NORMAL PICKUPS</li></ul></div><img src="images/gr_55_floorboard.jpg" style="font-family: Arial; width: 1218px; height: 717px;" alt="KATANA FloorBoard Main Window" title="KATANA FloorBoard Main Window"><br style="font-family: Arial;"><br style="font-family: Arial;"><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">Modules and Effects Routing </span></h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'll explain </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">elsewhere </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">how
each of the tone and effects modules works. Here it is important to note that you can
enable a </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">tone</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (sound source) or an effects module by clicking on the
Enable/Disable switches (</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">rectangular </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">buttons), which will light when enabled (as DELAY
above) and be gray when disabled (as MFX above). You can also reroute
the AMP(lifier), NS(noise suppression), and MOD(ulation) effects to
come before or after the MFX(multi-effects) by clicking the STRUCTURE
1/2 buttons, where STRUCTURE 1 routes them after and STRUCTURE 2 routes
the before. You can also bypass the MFX module and the AMP-NS-MOD modules entirely.<br></span><h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tone Restrictions and Selection using the GK Pickup Switch</span></h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
Roland owner's manual calls the sounds generated by the PCM
synthesizers, the modeler, and the normal pickup(s) 'tones'. There
are some restrictions on the functions that can be used with each tone
and with the normal pickup; please refer to the following information
from the owner's manual. For additional details, refer to the indicated owner's manual pages.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img src="images/patch_restrictions_gk.jpg" style="font-family: Arial; width: 819px; height: 400px;" alt="Patch restrictions and GK switch dependencies." title="Patch restrictions and GK switch dependencies."><br style="font-family: Arial;"></body></html>
